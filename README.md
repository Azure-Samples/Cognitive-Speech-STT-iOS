Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech To Text iOS SDK
==================

The Speech To Text client library is a client library for Microsoft Cognitive Services (formerly Project Oxford)
Speech To Text APIs.  

To add the client library dependency from an existing XCode Project:

1. Select your target application, and open the menu `File` then `Add Files to ...`
2. Navigate to `Speech > SpeechToText > iOS > iPhoneOS`, select `SpeechSDK.framework`, and click `Add`.
3. Go to your project settings, by single clicking your project, and navigate to the `General` tab.  You'll notice that SpeechSDK.framework exists under the `Linked Frameworks and Libraries` section.
4. In the General tab, under the `Embedded Binaries` section, click the (+) button.   In the dialog, select `SpeechSDK.framework` and click the `Add` button.
5. If you wish to run on the iOS Simulator or MacOSX, repeat steps 2-4 but choose either `iPhoneSimulator` or `MacOSX` instead.

The Speech Recognition Sample
==========

This sample is an iOS application to demonstrate the use of Microsoft Cognitive Services (formerly Project Oxford)
Speech To Text API.

It demonstrates the following features using a wav file or external microphone input:

* Short-form recognition.
* Long-form dictation.
* Recognition with intent.

Build the sample
----------------

1. First, you must obtain a Speech API subscription key by following instructions in [Microsoft Cognitive Services subscription](<https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/sign-up>).

2.  Start XCode and choose the menu `File`, and `Open...` the workspace file `Speech > SpeechToText > iOS > SpeechSDK.xcworkspace`.

3.  In XCode, select menu `Product > Build` to build the sample,
    and `Run` to launch this sample app.


Running the sample
--------------

In XCode, select the menu `Product`, and `Run` to launch this sample app.

1.  In the application, press the button `Change Mode` to select what type of Speech would like to use.

2.  For modes where you would like both Speech recognition and Intent to work, you need to sign up [Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS)](<https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/sign-up>) and set the key values in
    luisAppID and luisSubscriptionID from `Samples\_SpeechRecognitionServerExample\_settings.plist`.

3. To Start recognition, press the Start button.
