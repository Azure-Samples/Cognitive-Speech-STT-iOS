MicrophoneRecognitionClientWithIntent  This client is optimal for applications that require for speech recognition *and* intent detection from microphone input.
When the microphone is turned on, audio data from the microphone is streamed to the speech recognition service. A built in Silence Detector is applied to the microphone data before it is sent to the recognition service. Returns speech recognition and intent results. Intent results are returned in structured JSON form (see https://LUIS.ai).

/**
Creates a DataRecognitionClient for speech recognition with acquired data, for example from a file or Bluetooth audio source.
<p>Data is broken up into buffers and each buffer is sent to the speech recognition service.
No modification is done to the buffers; if silence detection is required, it must be performed in an external pre-processing pass over the data.
Audio data must be PCM, mono, 16-bit sample, with sample rate of 16000 Hz.</p>
<p>The recognition service returns only speech recognition results and does not perform intent detection.</p>
@param speechRecognitionMode The speech recognition mode. <p>In Short Phrase mode, the client receives one final multiple N-best choice result.
In Long-form Dictation mode, the client receives multiple final results, based on where the service thinks sentence pauses are.</p>
@param language The language of the speech being recognized. The supported languages are:
* en-us: American English
* en-gb: British English
* de-de: German
* es-es: Spanish
* fr-fr: French
* it-it: Italian
* zh-cn: Mandarin Chinese
@param primaryOrSecondaryKey The primary or the secondary key.
You should periodically renew your key to prevent unauthorized use of your subscription. The recommended approach is to acquire two keys, a primary and a secondary and to rotate key usage between these two keys. While one key is disabled, the other key will still work, allowing your application to remain active while the disabled key is replaced.
@param delegate The protocol used to perform the callbacks/events upon during speech recognition.

[Deprecated] Creates a MicrophoneRecognitionClientWithIntent that uses the microphone as the input source.
<p>To initiate speech recognition, call the startMicAndRecognition method of this client. Once the microphone is turned on, data from the microphone is sent to the service.
A built-in Silence Detector is applied to the microphone data before it is sent to the recognition service. The service returns speech recognition results and structured intent results.
To terminate speech recognition and stop sending data to the service, call endMicAndRecognition.</p>
<p>The service returns structured intent results in JSON form (see https://LUIS.ai).</p>

@param primaryKey The primary key.  It's a best practice that the application rotate keys periodically. Between rotations, you would disable the primary key, making the secondary key the default, giving you time to swap out the primary.
